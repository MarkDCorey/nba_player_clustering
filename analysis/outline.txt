#CLUSTER INTERPRETABILITY
-What features are most representative of each cluster?
-What players?
-present feature and player cloud (within cluster size/color variations)
-silhouette score
-tsne
pca - for interpretability
nmf features by topic, more interpretable than pca

#TEAM DYNAMICS
-overlay clusters on lineup data
-aggregate pts_for and pts_against for cluster groupings
-assign net-plus minus for each cluster grouping for ranking
-run t-test on cluster groupings, calc confidence for each
-present process, findings, and potential applications
-changing dynamics over time (have optimal cluster groupings changed)

 #TEAM RECOMMENDER (example of application)
 -biggest needs/areas for improvement for each team
 -players ranked within cluster as most representative of that cluster
 -unique player value to each team (eg cluster X player
    would boost performance by Y)

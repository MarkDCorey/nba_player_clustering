NBA PLAYER TYPES AND OPTIMAL LINEUP COMPOSITION


PROJECT DESCRIPTION

-Determine whether we can meaningfully cluster players NBA players by style of play.

-Overlay player clusters on top of lineup performance data to find optimal cluster/lineup compositions.


APPLICATIONS

-Identify latent improvement opportunities (eg lineup composition, players to pursue through trade, draft or free-agency) for any team .

-Project rookie and college player cluster and NBA player comps.

-Determine unique player values across team.

-Determine whether optimal team/lineup compositions have changed over time and whether new trends in team/lineup compositions are developing.


PROCESS OUTLINE

-Scrape player and lineup statistics from NBA.com/Stats

-Identify feature set that captures per-possession offensive and defensive actions of players

-Build clustering model

-Measure within-cluster inertia and cluster separation, and determine optimal k cluster value

-Describe characteristic features of each cluster

-Merge the resulting cluster labels with lineup level data

-Group by cluster combination and determine statistical significance of each
